      <h1>Psychocybernetics</h1>
      <date>7/4/2023</date>

      <p>Most people don't have what they want in life simply because they don't put their brain to work on it. How can a rocket reache it's destination if you're not even programming it to do so? This is the firs element.</p>
      <p>The second element is just patience, right expectations and adaptability. Don't expect for your plans and goals to always remain the same. It's like a captain that expects the sea to alway be calm and for his ship to always go the same direction. A good Captain knows that some times he will need to make his ship change direction to reach the port. Could you imagine a Captain that looses hope every time he makes his ship change direction? As long as the port is the same, it does not matter how you reach it, but you must have the mental mealleability to accept change.</p>

      <h1>Digital Minimalism</h1>
      <date>6/4/2023</date>
  
      <p>The internet is a dangerous place. As humans we are not used to be confronted with so many different people.</p>
      <p>Nontheless when you go out and look at videos you are not confronted with random humans, you are confronted with the top of the top of creators. It is easy in this circumstance to feel overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>Not to talk about how every creator tries evyrithing to hook your attention. There is a whole science behind it. And yes of course it's not just the creators. All of this major platforms are carefully, sistematically designed to hook your attention and to trap your lower self.</p>
      <p>Of course renouncing to the internet and to consuming media would be silly. It is here that the idea of digital minimalism comes in to palce. Often time less is more. And the same goes for media.</p>
      <p>Personally I try to spend more time creating then I spend consuming. Or if i'm not creating I just try to reconnect to real life: call a friend,have a chat, have a walk, drink a tea... remember to be human being.</p>

    <h1>On Women</h1>
    <date>4/4/2023</date>
    <p>The only way not to get disturbed by feminine energy is to be centered on your purpose in this life. The love you have for your purpose must be stronger than the love you have for your woman.</p>
  
    <p>A woman might leave you out of the blue and you could remain with nothing. A deep purpose will always stay with you and it will bring you many resources and many other women</p> 
    <p>At the same time it is true that women are an essential part of life. The feminine helps us integrate our masculine, learn important lessons and deepen our experience of life. What would be a man without a woman?</p>
