    <h1 class="header">Who Am I</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">My story begins one morning on a subway. I’m about 17 years of age at that time and as usual, I’m commuting to school.

      That morning there happens to be a book in my hands and as I’m reading through it there’s one quote that strikes my attention. A quote I didn’t yet know will change my life forever:
      
          </p>

    <p class="paragraph-quote"> <i> “Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life. LSD shows you that there’s﻿ another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important—creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.” -Steve Jobs</i> </p>

    <div class="about-text-container">
    <p class="paragraph">Having much respect and admiration towards that man I started wondering what was it about this weird “LSD” thing that he praised so much. After spending some months of research into the substance and into its acquisition finally, the day comes when I try it for the first time. 

      What happened that day of course can not be put into words, but what I know for sure is that day something changed in me. I had the opportunity to glance at a wider spectrum of reality, a reality that was always there awaiting my attention but that I had never had the opportunity to glance at. </p>
    </div>

   <div class="about-text-container">
    <h1 class="header">Many Years Passed</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Many years have already passed since that moment. I read so many books, met so many people, made so many experiences, and experimented with different substances and psychedelics; but most importantly I delved deeper and deeper into the realms of spiritual and personal expansion. 

      A passion started to develop in me, a passion for expanding my consciousness as well as helping other people expand theirs.
      
      I completely transformed my life from that day: passing from being a mediocre, depressed, video game addict, brainwashed teenager condemned to a life of mediocrity to rediscovering a deep, spiritual part of myself; to finding once again the joy in living, my purpose in this life and accessing a higher, deeper and more meaningful dimension of existence.</p>
    </div>

   <div class="about-text-container">
    <h1 class="header">My Mission</h1>
    <p class="paragraph"> My mission now is to help people come out of mediocrity, come out of anxiety, come out of depression, and come out of a meaningless and brainwashed life. All of this thanks to a combination of psychedelics,spirituality and personal developement.</p>
